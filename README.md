Create a contact form that would be production-ready.
*The form should have the following fields:*
Name*, Email*, Phone Number, Address, City, State, Zipcode, Subject (with 3 or more predefined options), and a textarea for a message(1000 characters max.)

You may use jquery and jquery plug-ins, as well as any custom css and js you want. Please do not use front-end frameworks like foundation, etc.

Please create clean code and add any behaviors you think might make the page more visually interesting.

Do not worry about making any links work, or form(s) posting. Client side validation is encouraged.

You should be working in your own branch - generate commits at logical stop points. When you are finished, create a pull request and we will review your work. Do not push anything to master. 

please dont hesitate to email **dev@masteryconnect.com**, or contact us on Google Hangouts (**todd@masteryconnect.com**, **daniel@masteryconnect.com**, **eric@masteryconnect.com**) if you have any questions at all.
