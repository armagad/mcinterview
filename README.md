## Objective ##
---

Part I.

Create a contact form that would be production-ready.
*The form should have the following fields:*
First Name, Last Name, Phone, Email, and a textarea for a message(1000 characters max.)

Please use the design files in /graphics as a guide for the UI.

Place all of your HTML in the index.html file.

You may use jquery and jquery plug-ins, as well as any custom css and js you want. Please do not use front-end frameworks like foundation, etc.

Please create clean code and add any behaviors you think might make the page more visually interesting.

Do not worry about making any links work, or form(s) posting.


Part II.

Create a javascript function that validates the contact for data. It should validate all of the fields.


Part III.

You have the option to use one of the following languages for this part: Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Go or Java. In a separate file, create a class (or it's equivalent in the language you chose). The class should have 2 methods, one that accepts a string as a param, and returns a hash.

The method will return each unique letter (case-insensitive) the string contains in order from most frequent to least frequent.

eg. if the input string is 'foo bar baz', the return should be {a=>2, b=>2, o=>2, f=>1, r=>1, z=>1}

Use the text 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Morbi tincidunt arcu eget lacus blandit efficitur' as the string parameter.

The second method takes an integer and returns an array with all of the integer's divisors(except for 1 and the number itself). If the number is prime return the string '(integer) is prime'.

Example:

* divisors(12); #should return [2,3,4,6]
* divisors(25); #should return [5]
* divisors(13); #should return "13 is prime"

You can assume that you will only get positive integers as inputs.
